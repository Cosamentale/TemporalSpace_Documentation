# Mouvement Recording 

For a first prototype, it was arbitrarily chosen to capture the position of a person's face captured by the camera and to retranscribe this data onto a 64x64 pixel png image.

We thus obtain images of this type, where the red and green pixel colors are equivalent to the x and y position of the face on the video coordinates( normalized from 0 to 1). Finally, the blue color is equivalent to the model's detection score (the closer the value is to 1, the more certain the model is of having detected a face).
