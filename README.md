Documentation of MODINA's program residency

This repo hosts the documentation for the Temporal Space project produced as part of the ***[Modina]([https://eff.org](https://modina.eu/about/])*** residency programme. This project is hosted by the ***[STL]([https://www.stl.ee/])*** in partnership with the University of Tallinn.

### About
Temporal Space is a multimedia dance installation emphasizing curiosity, play, and the exploratory generation of movement via visual and acoustic feedback. Set in a dimmed environment, this project encourages proprioception of the dark, and the interplay between the seen and the unseen, to produce a collective visualization of captured movement and choreography. With no professional performers, the audience assumes the role of dancer, choreographer, and eventually viewer, in a room of interactive zones, each bestowed with unique rules and feedback triggers. Alternating between phases of interacting and observing, the public is able to witness a collaborative result of their captured and altered parameters, then iterate further on their collective inquiry. By leveraging affordable arrays of webcams as infrared sensors, and utilizing AI to parse data through facial, body, object recognition, as well as interpolate captured footage with previous/pictorial references, the project merges the audience’s curiosity and playfulness with AI’s own playful interpretations of movement capture to produce and archive real-time, iterative interactivity as visualized choreography. 


### Open-Source Sharing and Documentation:
In the spirit of MODINA’s open-sourcing of technology, and the general importance of sharing knowledge. By providing hands-on demonstrations and sharing code repositories, we want to encourage both dancers and technologists to adapt the concepts we are exploring. Additionally, we will document the process of the project, as well as the archiving of Visualization results, ensuring that the knowledge and insights gained from this project are shared with a wider community.
